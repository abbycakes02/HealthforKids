# HealthforKids
Objective: We are developing an educational initiative aimed at promoting health awareness among children.

# How to use:
- Download and install Node.js + react-router-dom
- Open the terminal and `cd` into the health_for_kids directory if not already in
- Install the dependencies by running the command: `npm install`
- Run the application in developer mode by running the command: `npm run dev`
- Open project in the browser. Vite will display a link, such as http://127.0.0.1:5173 to click on or copy/paste that will take you to the localhost port where the project is running. 
- Press `q + enter` to exit and return to the terminal command line.
- Command + s to rerender the page with the new code

# Pushing Code to the Repository (Frequent Updates Recommended):
1. `git add [file_name]` or `git add .` 
    - Use `git add .` to stage all changes, or specify individual files with `git add [file_name]` for more control.
    - Best practice: Stage only relevant files to avoid unintended changes being committed.

2. `git commit -m "[descriptive_message]"` 
    - Include a meaningful commit message that clearly summarizes the changes, making it easier to track the history and purpose of each update.

3. `git push` 
    - Pushes the committed changes to the remote repository.
    - Regularly pushing small, incremental changes helps maintain version control
